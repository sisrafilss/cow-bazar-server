# Cow Bazar 
## A reliable cow shop

CowBazar is a cow website of a famous cow farm in Bangladesh. You can visit the CowBazar website from the following links:

Hosted in Vercel: [https://cow-bazar-client.vercel.app/](https://cow-bazar-client.vercel.app/)

Hosted in Firebase: [https://cow-bazar.web.app/](https://cow-bazar.web.app/)

## How to run the project in Local Machine
* First of all clone this repository
* Add a `.evn.local` file in the root and add your firebase credential here.
* run `npm install` to install necessary packages.
* run `npm run dev` and it will open in your local machine. Visit the show URL on the terminal.

## Important Note
I initially deployed this website on `Vercel` and encountered an error with the `onAuthStateChanged` method of Firebase after deployment. The method functioned perfectly on my local machine.

I spent a considerable amount of time troubleshooting the issue, but unfortunately, it persisted. I even sought assistance from 'Abu Sani Foysal' and another support representative during a support session. While they were unable to pinpoint the exact cause, they suggested hosting the website on Firebase itself in hopes of resolving the problem. However, even after migrating to Firebase hosting, the issue remains unresolved.

Therefore, to effectively test the website's functionalities, including login, you'll need to clone the project and run it on your local machine. Unfortunately, testing the features directly through the deployed version is currently not possible.
